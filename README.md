# SysA-D
System Analysis &amp; Design
The DriverPass project was for a client who wanted a system to help customers prepare for their driving tests. The system needed to offer online classes, practice tests, lesson scheduling, and account management while allowing administrators to update rules and manage users. I think I did well in making sure all the important functions were included and clearly mapped out in the use case diagram. If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine how different user roles interact with the system to make sure permissions are clear and well-structured. I focused on understanding the userâ€™s needs by carefully analyzing how each actor would interact with the system and making sure their actions were logically connected. It is important to consider the user's needs because a system that is confusing or missing key functions will not be useful. When designing software, I start by breaking down the requirements and organizing them into clear functions and user interactions. In the future, I would focus more on refining system security and optimizing workflows to make sure the design is both user-friendly and efficient.
